 * This is important now because we are going to allow the client to define their own business rules seperate from the system defined business rules.
 * So we need a way to merge all client defined and system defined business rules into one location.
 * Then the rule broker will execute business rules from the D-Data structure and not the rules library per-say.
 * This will allow the system to expand much more dynamically and even be user-defined & flexible to client needs.
